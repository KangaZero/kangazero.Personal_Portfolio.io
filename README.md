**What?**

This is a personal portfolio website that showcases works that will be done throughout this 6-month bootcamp course. Currently it is rather basic and only ultilizes my current knowledge of HTML and CSS.  

The website can be seen as a "cover letter" that will be more interactive in the future, with multiple new linked pages and to showcase my skills and collabration with other programmers. 

**Why?**

This portfolio serves not just as an assignment but also for my whole career as a (front-end) programmer.
As of right now it only includes basic html and css, but for future, the implementation of libraries such as Node.js, bootstrap etc, as well as Javascript (and maybe a new non-existent language) will be implemented as my skills and experience increases. 

**Acquired Knowledge**

I have learnt quite a bit throughout the making of this website.
I cannot say that I have understood nor mastered any of the features implemented, however here the important bits:

- Ultising the "Display: Flex;" in CSS, and the "align-items" and "justify-content" properties in moving boxes around.
- Adding "transition" and "animation" features to links with pseudo-classes.
